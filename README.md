## Study experience
- This online course requires an Ubuntu system, but the actual assignments only require a Python library. I didn't understand it. There are three lab exams and two assignments, which are very demanding. The final exam is extremely difficult because it's all problem-solving questions, and the questions are very obscure. I think XJTLU doesn't actually have a professor capable of teaching this course.
